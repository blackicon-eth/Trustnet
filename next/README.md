# Trustnet

TrustNET is a farcaster mini-app that allows users to give and request undercollateralized loans.
The user is incentivized to be honest and trustworthy, since they can lose their reputation if they default on a loan.
A Soulbound Token (SBT) is minted to the user's Farcaster custody address when the loan isn't repaid on time.
The user can verify their humanity through Humanity Protocol. Just connect to Farcaster with the Ethereum wallet on which behalf the humanity credential was issued, and click the "verify" button in your account page.
